This is the PHP binding for the FreeMED 0.9.x+ data relay. It requires:

 * PHP 5.1.0+
 * PHP JSON extension (php5-json for Debian)
 * PHP CURL extension (php5-curl for Debian)

Documentation can be generated using NaturalDocs.

This hasn't been fully tested, and the following caveats are known:

 * Associative arrays are returned as stdObject objects, so the would need
   to be casted to arrays if they are used in that way.
 * Little to no error handling exists. Be ware of this.
